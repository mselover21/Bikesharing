# Bikesharing

## Goals
The goal of this analysis is to use Citibike data from New York City to determine if the same type of business can be created in Des Moines Iowa. There is one thing to take into account. These two cities are very different when it comes to population. Even though the populations are very different there are several questions we can ask that will give us insight into starting the business in Iowa.
- How long are the bikes checkout for?
- What is the target demographic?
- When during the week is the service most used?
- When during the week is the dervice used the least?

### Analysis

The fist question I started with was how long is the trip duration for all users?

It appears that the vast majority of rides 1 minute and 30 minutes.

The next question I asked was how do the checkout times compare when looking at the gender of the user?

The data shows that Men makeup a majority of all users with just under 110,000 users and Women with just under 35,000 users. Although there is a large population on Women who use this service it is Men who are the primary users.

Next I wanted to find out at what time of day and day of the week the service is ustilized.

On the weekdays(M-F) the majority of use happens between 6am-9am and 4pm-8pm. These peak times appear connected to users heading to and from work. On the weekends(Sat and Sun) peak usage starts around 9am and ends around 7pm. This appears connected to users days off from work and shows that they are using the service on the weekends during longer periods.

Next I wanted to see how the heat map of users would breakdown by gender.

The same is true for weekday and weekend usage as the previous heat map. By breaking it down by gender it does show that men use the service the most.

The last thing I wanted to look at was the breakdown of the usertype day of the week.

This data is a little more interesting, it does show that the majority of Subscribers are men followed by women and then unknown. However, when looking at just Customers there is more of an even split and shows that unkown genders use the service the most and on weekends. 

#### Summary
To summarize there are many insights that can be gathered from this analysis. When looking at target demographic, the data shows that men are the primary users of Citibike services. Additionally me are also the highest group of subscribers followed up by women. The analysis also shows that the peak usage times coincide with customer going to and coming from work on Mondays-Fridays with the majority trip time being between 2-30 minutes. I would recommend further anaylsis of the subscribers usertype as they are repeat customers and can help ensure profit. Specifically I think looking at the ages of those who are subscribed to the service will help with product marketing. I also would look further into the customers category. These users do not make up a large portion of the data but I would be interested to know why these customers do not make the leap to subscribers. All in all after analyzing the data it appears that the target demographic is men and this business could become successful due the majority of use coinciding with normal business hours.
